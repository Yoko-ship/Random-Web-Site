            <span>Hi! I am Luise but my friends call me Lul.<br>
                I’m from Denmark, born in Helsingør, moved to Copenhagen, met <br>
                David in Rome and settled down in Stockholm in 2008. I have a <br>
                Bachelor degree in Social studies from University College of <br>
                Copenhagen from 2008. We started Green Kitchen Stories in <br>
                 2009. In 2014 I graduated as a Dipl. Holistic Nutritional Therapist <br>
                  at School of Nutritional Medicine in Stockholm. I’m the lucky <br>
                  mom of 3 wild & vegetable eating kids. I love everything green <br>
                  from broccoli to smoothies. I can not live without kombucha, <br>
                  chocolate and coffee. I’m addicted to travel, ferment sauerkraut <br>
                  and play outside with my kids.

                We started Green Kitchen Stories back in 2009! — and
                the site has basically not changed at all since the very
                beginning. But after years of talking about a redesign, we
                finally got it done. This is Green Kitchen Stories 2.0 and we
                are really happy with how it has turned out.
                <br>
                <br>

                
                There is a new and totally improved recipe archive where you
                can see preview images of all the recipes and scroll or filter
                the categories.  A Life & Travel section where we have
                gathered some of our travel guides and photos and posts
                about the kids. A much improved book section and a new
                video section. We will also be adding a shop later on that we
                 are very excited about!
                <br>
                <br>
                Hope you will enjoy the new site!<br>

            <span>This book captures the two different cooking situations we often find <br>
                ourselves in throughout a week. We’ve got recipes for the little moments <br>
                – The QUICK. The easy before-work-breakfasts, the simple but special lunch <br>
                you make for yourself, the weekday dinner when you don’t want to spend <br>
                the whole day in the kitchen but still want to eat something delicious.An <br>
                easy soba and tofu salad, a blitz-roasted tomato and harissa pasta<br>
                served over yogurt, or a speedy lentil and feta bake. Quick, hands-off, low <br>
                effort – big flavor! But we also cover the special moments – The SLOW.<br>
                When cooking becomes the best part of the day. When you put on your <br>
                favorite music and focus on making homemade kimchi burgers,<br>
                mandolin fennel thinly for a crunchy slaw, cook a 4 hour vegetable ragu<br>
                 pick up that special cheese, or place potatoes in salt brine on Sunday <br>
                 because you want to serve fermented fries the next week. Food you cook <br>
                 when you have friends coming over or when you just want an excuse<br>
                 to have a joyful moment. We hope it can be a reminder to balance the quick <br>
                  and slow in the kitchen. And in life. A cookbook but also a conversation <br>
                  about how food can be our best therapy, friend and the ultimate joy.<br>
